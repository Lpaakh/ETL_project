Project Intro/Objective
The aim of this project is to perform ETL and merge two datasets - PPP loans and COVID-19 cases for California - to allow researchers to evaluate for a possible link between COVID-19 infection cases and receipt of PPP loans. This project was co-engineered by four people: Stephen Hong, Laura Paakh May, Nghia Nguyen, and Sagar Patel.

## Methods and Technologies Used

Step 1 - Extract the data 
Searched Kaggle and downloaded four databases:
  A. PPP loan
  B. US county demographics
  C. US county and covid cases
  D. US county and corresponding zip codes

Step 2 - ERD
Create Entity Relationship Diagram.

Step 3 - Transform 
Cleaned the data using python and jupyter notebook.

Step 4 - SQL
Created SQL tables using postgreSQL.

Step 5 - Load
Connect to PostgreSQL and upload data to tables.
